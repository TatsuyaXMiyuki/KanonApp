Kanon is a server which adds extra functionality to AnYme.

The features are:

* Add notes to episodes you have watched
* Save unlimited waifus to your profile
* Get accurate recommendations based on shows you like

Obviously more will come soon, however this is just a start (feel free to request new features on the Discord server!!!)

The data will be kept in sync on the KanonApp server which means it is available on all your devices.
